#### c)
The additive operators are left-associative.  The relational operators are also left-associative.
#### d)
It's not possible because it is a prefix unary "not" operator.
#### e)
By having negation be of lower precedence than the multiplication operator, it allows us to keep the correct order of operations by binding higher precedence operators more tightly than negation.
