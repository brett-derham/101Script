    <h1>Story</h1>
    <div class = "centerParagraph">
    <p>101Script is a simple, easy-to-read programming language intended to be used by 
        those new to programming. There are multiple ways to write certain operations 
        to ease beginners into this language and others similar to it. Thanks to 
        101Script's omission of extra symbols in its syntax, along with the fact that 
        it is weakly and dynamically typed, users will be able to run code without the 
        need to pore over tedious details of the code.<br>
        101Script is designed for users with little to no programming experience.
        We believe that programming is essential and should be accessible to everyone.
        We took inspiration from Javascript and similar programming languages to give 
        users the option to code using traditional programming or keywords.<br>
        101Script equates : "gets" as "=", "addedTo" as "+=", "equals" as "=" and many 
        more cool quirks.
